# event keeps a regular expression matching the event. To get
# power events only, just use something like "event=button power.*"
# to catch it.
# action keeps the command to be executed after an event occurs
# In case of the power event above, your entry may look this way:
#event=button power.*
#action=/sbin/init 0

# Optionally you can specify the placeholder %e. It will pass
# through the whole kernel event message to the program you've
# specified.

event=video/brightnessdown
action=xbacklight -time 100 -dec 2.5
